## Vocabulary 

- **RDBMS:** The software that manages the data, i.e. handles it's storage and retrieval. Runs the database server
- **Database:** Sometimes used interchangably with a DBMS; The actual location of the data stored on disk; You won't interact with this directly, but rather, through the DBMS.
- **Database Client:** a program that can be used to connect to a database. Each database usually comes with an officially sanctioned command line client, and there are many different GUI database clients as well.
- **Database Server:** a computer that runs the DBMS and stores the data, typically either on-premises or in the cloud.
- **DDL:** Data definition language; commands that change the structure of the database or the DBMS itself, or change the structure of tables in the database. We will not be focusing on this part of SQL.
- **DML:** Data manipulation language; used to insert, ***update, delete, and retrieve*** information from databases. We will be focusing on the the retrieval part of this.
- **SQL** = Structured Query Language
