Window based operating system:

WYSIWYG
What You See Is What You Get

- you see all the options
- all the menu options live in the menu

Unfortunately, w/ a WSYWYG interface, 
what you see is ALL you get.
Command Line Interface (CLI) is a way to 
directly issue commands to your OS.

- there are hundreds/thousands of CL commands

We need to be able to orient ourselves on the command line. You may be connecting to servers only through the command line...

Relative Path vs. Absolute Path
Relative path example: the gas station is two blocks to the left.
Absolute Path: the full address or lat/long of that exact gas station

pwd "print working directory"
pwd returns the full, absolute path to where you are currently
ls    "on its own" gives us the files/folders of our pwd
ls some_subdirectory_from_our_pwd (relative)
cd ..     navigates "up" a directory (relative to your pwd)
cd ~      navigate to your home directory which is /Users/your_username
/               means "root", like C:\
/Applications   is the applications folder  
/Users          is the users folder for all user accounts
/Users/your_username/Desktop
/Users/your_username/Downloads
/Users/your_username/Documents
/Users/your_username is ~
cd ~ is the same as cd /Users/your_username

mv target destination
# use move to rename a file
mv old.txt new.txt
# renames old.txt to new.txt
# and ..
mv old.txt project/new.txt
# move old.txt into project
mv old.txt project/old.txt
mv old.txt project/
# move old.txt up a directory
mv old.txt ..
# move old.txt up then into another folder
mv old.txt ../project2
copy (cp) works like move (mv)
cp target destination
cp target.txt copy.txt
cp file.txt project/
cp file.txt file2.txt
